# Judge Go

Judge Go is a discord bot to add a little "fun" to your discord servers. Main functionality at the moment is ability to create sound clips from youtube videos to be played back later into voice channels via chat commands.

ToDo:

1) Discord package probably should be split up so I don't just have one giant namespace with everything globally available.
2) Error handling needs to be revisited
3) Setup CI
